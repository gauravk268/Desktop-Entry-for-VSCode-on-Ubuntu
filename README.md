# VSCode

Desktop entry file for VSCode on ubuntu
If you find that you are unable to get the VSCode icon in your All Application menu
then take this desktop entry and save it to 
/home/your_username/.local/share/applications

if you can't find .local press ctrl+h

then paste this .desktop file and change the execution and icon location.
in my case VSCode was saved in download folder, change this as per your system and VSCode location
